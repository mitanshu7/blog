Hi! I'm Mitanshu Sukhwani, a tech enthusiast with a Master's degree in Physics from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/). After completing my studies, I spent a year as a Project Associate at [IISER Tirupati](https://www.iisertirupati.ac.in/), where I worked on EEG data, network science, and the mathematical modeling of mammalian brains. In my free time, I explore projects in Machine Learning (ML) and Linux.

I'm passionate about the intersection of neuroscience, software, and data, and I enjoy working on innovative solutions that blend technology with real-world challenges. When I'm not coding or diving into new AI ideas, you'll likely find me enjoying a cup of coffee and spending time with my cats.

This blog is a space where I share my thoughts on software, high-performance computing, and, of course, coffee.
